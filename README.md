The engineer option requires the user to input the name, ID, email, and github username.

The manager option requires the user to input the name, ID, email, and office number.

Once all the information is collected, the user chooses to create another employee or not by selection "Yes" or "No".

If they choose "Yes", the employee type question appears and they go through the same process.

If they choose "No", the html page is generated with all the employees created.
